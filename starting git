TO SETUP
1. Make a github repository
2. you should see a link like this: https://github.com/keeeeeeen/drone25.git
3. Make a folder whereever you want (I do on my desktop)
4. git clone https://github.com/keeeeeeen/drone25.git

Now you have a folder on your desktop where you can git push and it should push to the github

TO PUSH
git add . (For all files) or git add file.extention (for specific files)
git commit -m "WHATEVER", or git commit and then write whatever message, ctrl+O, :wq,
git push

SETTING UP A GITIGNORE
1. In the folder, make a file named .gitignore
2. add whatever files needed (__pycache__/, etc.) into it and it should grey out when saved
